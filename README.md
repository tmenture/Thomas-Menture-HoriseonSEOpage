# Code Refactor Starter Code
## About The Project
### This project was about refactoring Horiseons website to:
    - Meet accesability standards
    - Have proper html semantics
    - Have proper image alt attrributes
    - Have proper format througout the code

With that criteria, changes were made to specific areas of the html to properly connect nav bar functions.

The necessary alt atributes were given to images for accesability standards.

Properly spaced and labled each section with comments and html semantics to ensure a much easier time reading the code.

And finally, dove into the css and made the necessary changes, after adding the semantics to the html file, as well as, condensed a lot of the css to avoid repetative code.
